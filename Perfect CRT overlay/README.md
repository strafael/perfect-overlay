I never liked the available CRT overlays so I made a new one that actually want to use, trying to address all the flaws that I saw in previous overlays. I made this for myself, but I'm sharing just in case there are others who like it.

Features:

-Brightest CRT overlay available.

-No washed out colors, the original tones are kept.

-Rounded screen TV frame with minimal picture obstruction.

-Both scanlines and phosphor effects included, for a more realistic look.

It's recommended to increase one or two points the Brightness over your regular setting, to compensate for the loss of light due the simulated CRT grid. Use it together with Bilinear filter in the video settings.

Enjoy.

*If you don't mind cranking up the brightness and likes an accurate display, check out my 240p CRT overlay as well:
