After completing the Game Boy family overlays, it's the Sega Game Gear's turn.

-Features:

Most of the original screen aspects simulated (vertical "scanlines", RGB subpixels, backlit area, LCD grid).

Original 4:3 full screen pixel perfect.

The most authentic way to play Game Gear on a 480p screen.

This overlay is designed to recreate the screen features of the original, BUT not to the point of looking for an exact copy, as I don't think anyone would want that on the Miyoo. The original Game Gear uses a primitive passive matrix display that would be considered atrocious compared to the worst modern displays: very low contrast, low brightness, very sensitive polarized screen with only a few usable degrees, muted and tinted colors, uneven backlit, heavy ghosting, vertical blurring, etc. I'm keeping the characteristics that define a GG but in a clean and more tolerable form. In short, it's like the original but with most of its defects polished or toned down, to achieve a better image and make the games look better, but without losing the authentic look.

This, like my GBC and GBA, is a dark, but realistic overlay. I use it indoors at a brightness of 7 to 9, depending on the colors of the game or the lighting in the room. I would say that at 9 of brightness it's still brighter than an original Game Gear display. All the photos I posted were taken with my MM+ at 9 of brightness and show true colors. As with all my previous overlays, it's key to use it with these color settings: 7-10-14-18; Otherwise the games may look too dark or washed out and not like in my pictures. If you want to use this overlay on other systems than the MM+, you will need to find an equivalent color configuration or it will also look dark and lifeless. All my overlays are designed to work at the default opacity of 1.00; If you want to make them brighter, increase the screen brightness. They work like a shader. Don't decrease the opacity value, otherwise it will ruin the intended effect.
