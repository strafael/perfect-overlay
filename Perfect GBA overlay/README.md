I know some of you were waiting for this. ;)

Features:

Original GBA subpixel simulation for authentic feel.

Pixel-perfect image in full screen with very minimal artifacts.

2 versions: The regular one with the best image quality (but darker) and a slightly brighter version (brt) but with slightly more pronounced artifacts (most of you won't even notice).

If you know my previous overlays, you know what to expect. This is not a bezel with a generic grid, it's a full screen simulation of the original display, like a GPU shader. I first tried to copy a GBA with a reflective screen (AGB-001), but with the colors corrected in the emulator it didn't look good, so I finally opted to recreate a backlit SP with brighter colors (AGS-101). With this one I'm pushing the limits of what can be displayed on a 480p screen, as the GBAs have more resolution/detail than the previous GBs. It's not 100% perfect but I'm happy with the balance I've achieved. You shouldn't notice many defects at normal gaming distances, except if you hold the screen to your nose and start counting pixels.

This, like the GBC and CRT-240p, is a dark overlay and is designed to be used with the same MM+ color settings recommended in my previous GB overlays: 7-10-14-18. With these settings there's enought room to play with the brightness. I use the "Perfect_GBA" overlay with a value between 8 and 9 (all the photos in my post were taken with the brightness at 9). Don't try it with the Miyoo's default color settings, it will look too dark and lifeless. If you want to use this overlay on other systems than MM+, you will need to find an equivalent color configuration or it will also look dark and lifeless. That's key in my overlays, the original look can't be achieved any other way.

The "Perfect_GBA(brt)" is a slightly brighter version at the cost of slightly worse image quality than "Perfect_GBA". It's just for the people who like brighter games and can't be happy with the regular version. The regular version with 10 of brightness is comparable to a Nintendo DS Lite at 3 of brightness (out of 4). I have tested it.
